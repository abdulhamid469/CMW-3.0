/**
 * Task Description:**
 *   1. **Scenario:**
 *   You are tasked to simulate a simple shopping experience using conditional statements and loops at a supermarket.
 *    2. **Requirements:**
 *       - Create a TypeScript program that simulates a shopping scenario with multiple conditions.
 *       - Utilize if-else, if-else if-else statements for decision making based on different scenarios encountered while shopping.
 *       - Incorporate nested loops to simulate actions within various sections of the supermarket.
 *   3. **Functionalities to Include:**
 *       - **Scenario 1 - Buying Groceries:**
 *           - Simulate buying fruits, vegetables, and groceries.
 *           - Apply if-else statements to check specific conditions:
 *               - Check if the customer wants fruits or vegetables.
 *               - Based on the choice, suggest different items available and their prices.
 *               - Display the total bill.
 *       - **Scenario 2 - Checking Discounts:**
 *           - Introduce a discount scenario based on the total bill amount.
 *           - Use if-else if-else statements to apply discounts:
 *               - If the bill amount is above a certain value, apply a discount.
 *               - Display the discounted total.
 *       - **Scenario 3 - Checkout Process:**
 *          - Simulate the checkout process.
 *           - Use nested loops to ask for payment methods:
 *               - First, ask the user for the preferred payment method (nested loop for payment options).
 *              - Display a confirmation message based on the payment method chosen.
